# hackerreader
A demo project in Android, showcasing Dagger 2, RxJava, MVVM, and DBFlow.

## Running the demo
You should have Java 8 JDK installed in your system, because the project uses retrolambda.
Once you have it installed, you have to configure the jdk path in app/build.gradle:59 or it won't compile.
All other dependencies are automatically downloaded by Gradle.
